The title of Education Ambassador is conferred on people by the ISOGG Committee who have championed the cause of ISOGG (as defined in our [Mission Statement](/#our-mission)), namely to educate the world about genetic genealogy, and are actively involved in ongoing educational and advocacy activities that further that goal, both nationally and internationally. Advocacy activities include liaising with academia, government and other official bodies on behalf of ISOGG.
