<p style="font-size:16px;text-align:center;">**...the first society founded to promote the use of DNA testing in genealogy**</p>

### Our Mission

The mission of the International Society of Genetic Genealogy is to:

<p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%;text-align:center;">*Advocate for and educate about the use of genetics as a tool for genealogical research while promoting a supportive network for genetic genealogists.*</p>

How do we accomplish our mission? By educating others about the use of genetics in genealogy.  This is done through workshops, our [wiki](http://isogg.org/wiki/), a speaker's bureau, our forums, and meetings. Although we do not have regular meetings, meetings are important as they allow for the dissemination of information and help maintain forward momentum.  Even though ISOGG members are geographically spread out, we do what is possible to hold meetings at events and online.

### More About Us

This society is a non-commercial non-profit organization.  There are **NO** dues or fees to join, it is entirely self-supporting by its members.  **YOU** choose what you wish to give.  Whether it's your time to give a presentation or host a workshop at your local genealogical society, or create photocopies to promote the society at a convention, it is up to you.  You will not be asked to spend your time or contribute in a way you do not wish to.  You may never end up participating in that manner, but may just join to learn and network, and that is okay too.
