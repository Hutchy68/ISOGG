### Please Remember

There are **NO dues or fees** to join, **ISOOG is free** and entirely self-supporting by its members. YOU choose what you wish to give. This may be your time to give a presentation or host a workshop at your local genealogical society, or create photocopies to promote the society at a convention. You will not be asked to spend your time or contribute to ISOGG. You may join to just learn and network.
